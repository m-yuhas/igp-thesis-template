# IGP Thesis Template (Unofficial)
[中文（简体）](论文型板（非官方）) [Bahasa Melayu](Templat Tesis IGP (Tak Rasmi))

This template for IGP theses is based on the unofficial (ASE thesis template)[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/phd-thesis-ntu-singapore-asian-school-of-the-environment-unofficial/jgtmdbzcrzzt] by Marciar Rabonza.  Please thank her for doing the heavy lifting.  

## Change Log
I have made the following changes:
* NTUASE_MR.cls renamed to IGPthesis.cls to match IEEE LaTeX file naming scheme.
* The IGPthesis class can now take three options:
  * twosided - use this option if you are preparing a PDF for binding.  It will insert blank pages to prevent chapters from starting on even pages.
  * ieeebib - use this option if you prefer the IEEE citation style.
  * kbib - use this option if you prefer the AAAI citation style.
* Removing the warning when not using XeTeX (breakurl was throwing errors in XeTeX for me, use it at your own risk).
* Modified the cover page to match the example provided in [1].
* Added a title page to match the example provided in [1].
* The abstract is now formatted in the same way as the declarations and other front matter.
* Added a front matter section for list of acronyms.
* Added an "Other Publications" section.
* Updated the text in the candidate statement of originality, supervisor declaration, and authorship attribution statement to match the example in [1].
* Reordered the front matter to match the order recommended in [1].
* Automatically sign the candidate stament of originality, supervisor declaration, and authorship attribution statement if you have a transparent PNG of you and your supervisor's signatures.
* Added Theorem and Lemma environments.
* Added examples for subfigures, proofs, theorems, and lemmas, and algorithms.
