\theabstract{

Your goes abstract here.  I was recommended to write about 1000 words for a thesis abstract.  It should provide a brief background on your topic, identify the specific literature gap, and discuss each of the studies you performed to address this gap.  It should discuss the novelty and usefulness of your contributions and clarify what challenges remain.  Use of keywords after the abstract is optional.
